Locating content

The navigation sidebar contains buttons to access the content of this
CD according to category. The Search page provides a search engine for
locating content containing keywords. Click on the Search sidebar
button to go to the search page.

Since the content of this CD is delivered primarily in Adobe PDF

using the search features of your PDF viewer. For more information on
searching within a PDF file, see the help menu within your PDF viewer.

The CD also includes an index for the content of the book and the CD

----------------------------------------------------------------

Page and figure numbering

The material in the printed book and on this CD uses a numbering
scheme designed to allow you identify where to locate the material.

Pages in the book are numbered sequentially (1, 2, 3, ...). Pages in
sections on the CD are numbered according to their section. For
example, in Section 2.15 on the CD, the pages are numbered 2.15-1,
2.15-2, and so on. So if you see a simple page number, you know to
look for the page in the book. If you see a page number of the form
x.y-z, you know to look in Section x.y on the CD for page z.

Figures are also numbered differently in the book and on the CD. In
the book, figures are numbered with the chapter number and a
sequential figure number. For example, in Chapter 1, figures are
numbered 1.1, 1.2, and so on. On the CD, figures are numbered with the
section number and a sequential figure number within that section. For
example, in Section 2.15 on the CD, figures are numbered 2.15.1,
2.15.2, and so on. So if you see a figure number for the form x.y, you
know to look in Chapter x in the book for the y'th figure. If you see
a figure number of the form x.y.z, you know to look in Section x.y on
the CD for the z'th figure.

Finally, pages in the Glossary are numbered G-1, G-2, ..., and pages
in the Further Reading section are number FR-1, FR-2, ...
