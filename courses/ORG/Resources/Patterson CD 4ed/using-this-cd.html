<h2 id="systemReqs">System requirements</h2>

<h3>Operating system</h3>

<p>The navigation framework and some of the content on this CD is delivered in HTML and JavaScript. It is recommended that you install the latest version of your favorite HTML browser to view this CD. The content has been
verified on the following platforms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows XP and Windows Vista with Internet Explorer 6+ and Firefox 2+</li>
<li>Mac OS X with Safari and Firefox</li>
<li>Mandriva Linux with Firefox and Konqueror</li>
<li>(K)Ubuntu Linux with Firefox and Konqueror</li>
</ul>

<h3>PDF viewer</h3>
<p>The CD material includes PDF documents that you can read with a PDF viewer such as Adobe&reg; Acrobat&reg; or
Adobe Reader&reg;. Visit the <a href="http://www.adobe.com" target="_blank">Adobe home page</a> for more information.</p>


<h2 id="searching">Locating content</h2>
<p>The navigation sidebar contains buttons to access the content of this CD according to category.
The Search page provides a search engine for locating content containing keywords. Click on the Search sidebar
button to go to the search page.</p>
<p>Since the content of this CD is delivered primarily in Adobe PDF (Portable Document Format), you can search
within individual documents using the search features of your PDF viewer. For more information on searching
within a PDF file, see the help menu within your PDF viewer.</p>
<p>The CD also includes an index for the content of the book and the CD content. Index entries refer to content by
page number.</p>

<h2 id="numbering">Page and figure numbering</h2>
<p>The material in the printed book and on this CD uses a numbering scheme designed to allow you identify where
to locate the material.</p>
<p>Pages in the book are numbered sequentially (1, 2, 3, ...). Pages in sections on the CD are numbered according
to their section. For example, in Section 2.15 on the CD, the pages are numbered 2.15-1, 2.15-2, and so on. So
if you see a simple page number, you know to look for the page in the book. If you see a page number of the form
x.y-z, you know to look in Section x.y on the CD for page z.</p>
<p>Figures are also numbered differently in the book and on the CD. In the book, figures are numbered with the chapter number and a sequential figure number. For example, in Chapter 1, figures are numbered 1.1, 1.2, and so on.
On the CD, figures are numbered with the section number and a sequential figure number within that section. For
example, in Section 2.15 on the CD, figures are numbered 2.15.1, 2.15.2, and so on. So if you see a figure number for the form x.y, you know to look in Chapter x in the book for the y'th figure. If you see a figure number of the
form x.y.z, you know to look in Section x.y on the CD for the z'th figure.</p>
<p>Finally, pages in the Glossary are numbered G-1, G-2, ..., and pages in the Further Reading section are number
FR-1, FR-2, ...</p>
